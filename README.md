# Respitory Purpose

This repository is a catalogue of practice exercises I have done to better understand important features of various languages.

It will primarily consist of **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and **[C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/)**, as they are the languages that I am currently learning.

Each folder (project) will contain a README.md detailing the purpose of each project.
